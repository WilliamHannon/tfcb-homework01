---

This directory contains some of the **most important** ant research of the decade.

Understandably, as most people are not experts on ants like myself, they will not appreciate the *magnitude* of these results. Just take a look at these extraordinary images!

I am certain to finally be admitted into the Royal Society of Myrmecological Research for this!
- For one, the study design was awesome
- Also, the results are super novel
- Finally, the impact on society is immense

Just take a look at this blurb from [Myrmecological News](https://myrmecologicalnews.org/cms/):
>He's the genius of the century, just take a look at those pictures of Ants!!
